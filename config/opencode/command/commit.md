Commit code
- If there are staged changes, only commit those changes
- Never commit code directly to main or develop branch
- Use issue reference to prefix branch name if you have one, for example `SKU-123/feature-description`
- Never credit yourself
- Create clean, isolated, standalone commits
- Write clear, descriptive and brief commit messages
- Use Conventional Commits format for commit messages
- Only commit when I specifically instruct you to do so
- If working in multiple repositories, commit to each repository separately
