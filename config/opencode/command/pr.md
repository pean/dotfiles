Create Pull Request
- Never credit yourself
- Write clear, descriptive and brief pull request titles and descriptions
  - Describe only end result, not iterations made along the way
- Use the Pull Request template if available
- Create section with links to related PRs if there are any you know of
- Use Conventional commits format for pr title
- Only push to PR when I specifically instruct you to do so after the PR has been created
- Do not mention tests, test coverage etc
- Assign myself
- Create as draft
